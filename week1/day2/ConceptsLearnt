enumerate() function - 
The enumerate() function in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) while keeping track of the index of the current item. It returns an iterator that generates pairs of index and value for each element in the sequence.
syntax - enumerate(sequence, start=0)
example - 
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']

for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(index, fruit)

extend() function - 
The extend() method in Python is used to extend a list by appending elements from an iterable (such as a list, tuple, string, etc.) to the end of the original list. It modifies the list in place and does not create a new list. The elements from the iterable are added one by one to the end of the list.
syntax - list.extend(iterable)
example - 
original_list = [1, 2, 3]
new_elements = [4, 5, 6]

original_list.extend(new_elements)

print(original_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
